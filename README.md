Excel Upload Editor

A narrowly focused program for personal use as part of a part-time job)

Purpose of the program:
Narrowly focused software for editing downloads in Excel format. At a part-time job, there is a need to upload information on objects (boiler temperatures) several times a day (from 3 to 10).

Depending on the selected processing method:
1) Corrects the appearance of the unloading, for the convenience of work of colleagues (installers for whom this unloading is being done), removes unnecessary values. 
2) Highlights in color temperatures that go beyond normal operation (Above or below critical levels). 
3) Divides objects into areas: Each area is on a separate sheet, or in a separate Excel file, depending on the task.

Libraries used:
1) import re
2) import copy
3) import tkinter 
4) import openpyxl
